          <h1> Whats up, it's your soon-to-be favorite software engineer.... Mason Hill </h1>
          <p> I am a Software Engineer with 2 years of experience using Golang, CassandraDB, React, Node, Kafka, and Kibana in my role as a Software Engineer at Betable. I also got 4 years of experience using Java and Linux and 2 years of experience of using C++ during my time at The Kings University where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I enjoy golfing and soccer (having formely been a college soccer player), and I enjoy almost any outdoor activities such as mountain biking and snowmobiling. I also enjoy playing Rocket League (I'm top 10000 in the world humble brag humble brag). I love hanging out with people and getting to know others. You'll often find me making awful puns and cracking witty jokes, and I am a master at finding the perfect meme for any given situation. If you pull out Mario Kart or Ping Pong then prepare to get cooked because I am an absolute weapon at both.</p>

          <h2> Software Engineer at Betable (Current) - 2 years </h2>
          <p> I built 70% of a payment provider service, using Go and Cassandra along with the Ginkgo and Gomega testing packages.
            I also led a development team to modernize and repurpose a legacy React/NodeJS player support tool for a payment provider, completing 75% of the total work done of the project.
            During development I used Kibana, Nagios, and Elasticsearch in code deployment to ensure only high quality, performant code was being made as well as using them to debug issues in the staging environments.
            Created REST APIs for 3 separate microservices and built the backend that consumes them.

          <h2> Summer Researcher at The Kings University for the Dean of Computer Science - 4 months </h2>
          <p> I spent the summer of 2022 working as a research assistant to the Dean of Computer Science at the Kings University, Dr. Andrew Tappenden. I was responsible for rebuilding a Bash script that would subsume 
           and categorize API calls, as well as setting up 2 serivces using Docker, which I then had to make Bash scripts to generate data from them. I am unable to show the github repo of my work because of security and 
           privacy concerns, however I have a video demonstration of part of what it did and a poster that explains it more in depth. </p>
