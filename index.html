            <li>I am a Junior Full-Stack Software Engineer with a year 
              of professional experience using Golang, CassandraDB, ReactJS, NodeJS, Kafka, and Kibana 
              in my role as a Junior Software Engineer at Betable.
             </li><li> I also have 4 years of experience using Java and Linux and 2 years of experience of 
              using C++ during my time at The Kings University where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. </li><li> I enjoy golfing and soccer (having formerly been a college soccer player), and I enjoy almost any outdoor activities such as mountain biking and snowmobiling.</li><li> I also enjoy playing Rocket League (I'm top 10000 in the world humble brag humble brag). </li><li>I love hanging out with people and getting to know others.</li><li> You'll often find me making awful puns and cracking witty jokes, and I am a master at finding the perfect meme for any given situation.</li><li> If you pull out Mario Kart or Ping Pong then prepare to get cooked because I am an absolute weapon at both.</li>
              <li>I am also currently picking up Python</li>

          <h2> Junior Software Engineer at Betable (Company Closed Down) - 1 year </h2>
          <p> Wrote 70% of the code for one of the micro-services of a payment provider service, using Go and Cassandra.
            <br> Gutted, modernized and added to a legacy React/NodeJS player support tool for a payment provider, completing 75% of the total work done of the project. 
            <br> Used Kibana, Nagios, and Elasticsearch in code deployment for monitoring and debugging.
            <br> Authored comprehensive startup documentation for a legacy technology stack, detailing step-by-step procedures, system configurations, and operational guidelines to facilitate knowledge transfer and operational continuity.
            <br>I created REST APIs for 3 separate microservices and built the backend that consumes them. <br>When I first arrived at Betable I had never heard of Golang or CassandraDB and yet within a month I was fluent enough in both to push production-ready code. <br> Since Betable is a startup and the dev team is 12 people, I have gotten to wear many hats.<br> Since we used Agile I have been a part of story grooming on every project I've worked on, and even been tasked with starting and completing entire projects, such as a legacy player support tool that we wanted to rehash and update for a new service coming out.<br> I've also reviewed many pull requests since joining.

          <h2> Summer Researcher at The Kings University for the Dean of Computer Science - 4 months </h2>
          <p> I spent the summer of 2022 working as a research assistant to the Dean of Computer Science at the Kings University, Dr. Andrew Tappenden. I was responsible for rebuilding a Bash script that would subsume 
           and categorize API calls, as well as setting up 2 services using Docker, which I then had to make Bash scripts to generate data from them. I am unable to show the github repo of my work because of security and 
           privacy concerns, however I have a video demonstration of part of what it did and a poster that explains it more in depth. </p>
